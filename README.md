## Pre-Requisites

Other than a modern browser, there are no pre-requisites required to use
VisualIDE. However, some pre-requisites are required for development.

 * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
 * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - JavaScript Task Runner
 * [Bower](http://bower.io/) - Package Manager for the Web

### Setting Up for Development

 1. Install Node.js on a platform of your choice.
 2. Install Grunt: `npm install -g grunt`.
 3. Install Bower: `npm install -g bower`.
 4. Change into the project directory, then run `npm install`.

That's it, you're done!

Run `grunt serve` to open the project in your browser. While `grunt serve` 
is running, any code changes made will automatically be reflected in the browser.
